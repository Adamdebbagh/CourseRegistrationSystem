# CourseRegistrationSystem:

1- A student completes a registration request form and mails or delivers it to the registrar's office.
 
2- A clerk enters the request into the system. 

3- First, the Accounts Receivable subsystem is checked to ensure that no fees are owed from the previous quarter. 

4- Next, for each course, the student transcript is checked to ensure that the course prerequisites are completed. 

5- Then, class position availability is checked; If all checks are successful, the student's social security number is added to the class list.

6- The acknowledgment back to the student shows the result of registration processing as follows: 

	6-a If fees are owing, a bill is sent to the student; no registration is done and the acknowledgment contains the amount due. 
	6-b If prerequisites for a course are not


filled, the acknowledgment lists prerequisites not met and that course is not registered. 

	6-c If the class is full, the student acknowledgment is marked with 'course closed.â€™
	6-d If a student is accepted into a class, the day, time, and room are printed next to the course number. Total tuition owed is computed and printed on the acknowledgment. 
7- Student fee information is interfaced to the Accounts Receivable subsystem. 

8- Course enrollment reports are prepared for the instructors.
